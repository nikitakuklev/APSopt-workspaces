Example scripts used at APS

measure_lifetime.py -> (most useful) can be directly adapted if the PVs are available

changeSRSextupoles [TCL] -> (not useful) used to change the strength of the sextupoles relative to a save file taken before study

sextknobs.py -> (a bit useful) script to derive sextupole knobs from lattice using elegant

opt_funcs.py -> (a bit useful) main functions used in optimization. Something like 'master_eval_function' needs to be implemented for each machine.
